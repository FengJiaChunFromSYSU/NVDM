# Neural Variational Inference Document Modeling #

This code implements the Neural Inference Document Modeling (NVDM) in the paper "[Neural Variational Inference for Text Processing](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06038v3.pdf)".

To compute the perplexity for test document, if you use the latest ClassNLLCriterion, its parameter sizeAverage should be set true. 

I cannot get good results yet. Another Tensorflow implementation is at "(https://github.com/carpedm20/variational-text-tensorflow)".
